# backendPortfolio
a simple backend which will send objects containing data about my projects to the portfolio


This project will be a simple backend with data concering objects about my projects. Basically being written to demonstate my ability to write a restful API.

It will include unit testing with Xunit,Nsubsitutute and fluent assertions. 

It will be connected to a postgresSQL database on Heroku.

It uses Dapper for object relational mapping. 

I will eventually host in on Heroku.
